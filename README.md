# Linear_regression_on_bike_rentals
This project explores the relationship between bike rentals and various factors using linear regression. The data used in this project was taken from a bike rental company in the United States, and it contains information about the rentals, such as the number of rentals, the weather conditions, and the season.

The main goal of this project is to create a linear regression model that can predict the number of bike rentals based on different factors. The factors that we considered in this project include:

Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
Season (spring, summer, fall, winter)
Day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.)
Time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night)

The data used in this project is provided in the bike_rentals.csv file. This file contains information about bike rentals over a period of two years. The data was collected from a bike rental company in the United State
